1. Implement a C program that takes as command line arguments a command and its
   arguments. The command should run forever, and if it stops the program should
   start it up again. When the parent receives SIGINT (Ctrl-C) it should stop
   the command and stop itself too.

   * Usage example: ./myprog ping 127.0.0.1
   * Hints
     * Use execvp (man exec) to run the given command
     * To access the command line arguments in C, declare the main funciton as
       follows: int main(int argc, char** argv)
       * argc - argument count, including the command name itself
       * argv - array of command line arguments, with a NULL element at the end
              - argv[0] is the name of the command
              - argv[argc] is NULL
